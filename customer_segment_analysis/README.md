# Customer Segment Analysis 🛍️

Welcome to the **Customer Segment Analysis** project! This project aims to analyze customer data from a mall dataset to identify distinct segments of customers. By understanding customer behavior, we can create targeted marketing strategies and improve customer experience.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning techniques such as K-means clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing patterns, demographic information, and shopping habits. The goal is to group similar customers into segments and provide insights that businesses can act upon.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is titled **Mall_Customers.csv** and contains the following key features:

- **CustomerID**: A unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender**: The gender of the customer (Male/Female).
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Annual Income**: The annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
- **Spending Score**: A score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending.

## 🔧 Features and Methods

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Data cleaning and preparation for clustering.
   - Handling missing values and scaling features.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing demographic patterns.
   - Understanding relationships between features (e.g., Age vs. Spending Score).
   - Insights into customer distribution.

### 3. **Clustering using K-Means**
   - Applying the K-means algorithm to segment customers.
   - Choosing the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.
   - Visualizing customer segments.

### 4. **Segmentation Insights**
   - Analyzing each segment and providing recommendations.
   - Segment demographics and spending behavior.

## 📊 Visualization Examples

Here are some visualizations created as part of the analysis:

- **Spending Score Distribution**: A bar plot showing how customers are distributed by their spending scores.
- **Cluster Visualizations**: Scatter plots to represent clusters and how customers are grouped based on age, income, and spending behavior.
