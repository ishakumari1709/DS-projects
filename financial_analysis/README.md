# Bank Personal Loan Modeling - Data Analysis Project

This project is about analyzing bank customer data to predict whether a customer will accept a personal loan. We use Python for data analysis and machine learning to build a model that helps in making this prediction.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to use customer information like income, family size, and education to predict if they will accept a personal loan offer.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Programming language used
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To write and run the analysis
- **pandas**: For handling data
- **numpy**: For numerical operations
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: For visualizing data
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning models

## Steps Followed
1. **Data Loading**: We used a dataset named `Bank_Personal_Loan_Modelling.xlsx`.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We looked at the data to understand trends, relationships, and important features.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the data and prepared it for modeling.
4. **Modeling**: Applied machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest to predict loan acceptance.
5. **Results**: We evaluated the performance of each model.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Bank-Personal-Loan-Modeling.git
    ```
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Open the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook financial.ipynb
    ```

## Conclusion
This project shows how data analysis can help predict if a customer will take a loan. It's a simple but powerful example of how to use Python for data analysis and machine learning.
